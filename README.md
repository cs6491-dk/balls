3D Project
***

High level requirements:
 * Need some device which creates spheres and shoots/drops them into the
   space
 * There is a surface (infinite plane to start)
 * If a sphere intersects with the floor, it stops immediately
 * If a sphere hits another sphere, it should "roll" along the other
   sphere until it either hits the floor or contacts 2 (3?) other
spheres at which points it stops
